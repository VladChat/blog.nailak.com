&lt;p&gt;She glanced at her hands during a morning coffee break—the soft sheen of care was a quiet reminder that small rituals matter. Her group chat chirped again. Another clip of the Washington Commanders lighting up feeds. A rookie QB thread, a sideline jacket everyone suddenly wants, nostalgic burgundy-and-gold edits. She smiled, tapped to watch, and caught her reflection in the phone’s black edge. Nails clean. Cuticles moisturized. But her mind drifted to last week’s gym shower and the friend who whispered about a stubborn toenail turning yellow. Nail fungus can show up slowly.

&lt;p&gt;She glanced at her hands during a morning coffee break — the soft sheen of care was the quiet reminder that small rituals matter. After a late night streaming red-carpet highlights, she’d woken with a spark. Diamonds glittered, gowns swished, cameras flashed. But what stayed with her was simpler: the way each celebrity gestured with presence. The rings. The bracelets. The confident stillness of a palm on a hip. The story their hands told.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is Eye Cream Really Necessary?

&lt;p&gt;She glanced at her hands during a morning coffee break — the soft sheen of care was the quiet reminder that small rituals matter. The cup was warm, her to-do list was long, and her reflection in the window offered two little prompts. First: the delicate skin beneath her eyes, showing just a hint of late-night scrolling.
