## Essential At-Home Nail Growth Tips

### Nourish from Within

Healthy nails start with a healthy diet. Consuming foods rich in biotin, such as eggs, nuts, and avocados, can promote stronger nail growth. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish like salmon also contribute to nail health.

### Daily Nail Care Routine

- **Moisturizing:** Keep your cuticles hydrated with a nourishing oil or hand cream. This prevents dryness and promotes growth.
- **Gentle Filing:** File your nails in one direction to avoid splitting and breakage. Choose a fine-grit file for a smooth finish.
- **Protective Base Coat:** Use a strengthening base coat before applying nail polish to protect your nails from staining and breakage.

### Avoid Harsh Chemicals

Limit the use of harsh nail polish removers and opt for acetone-free formulas. These are gentler on your nails and help maintain their natural moisture.

## The Perfect Bridal Nail Look

### Matching Your Makeup

Coordinate your nail color with your makeup palette. Opt for soft pinks, nudes, or a classic French manicure that complements Lancôme's bridal collection.
